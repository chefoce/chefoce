Hello, my name is *Carlos Oceguera*. I am 40 years old and from the state of Sinaloa, 🇲🇽 Mexico. Since 2010, I have been working as a programming *teacher* at a technical 🏫school, where I teach subjects such as Programming Basics, C++, Object-Oriented Programming, Java, Databases, and Web Development. I hold a 🗞degree in 🖥**Software Development Engineering** and also have a 🗞**degree in 👨‍🍳Gastronomy**. I worked in the culinary field for five years, but I was always drawn to programming. I decided to make a radical change in my life and study programming. I am a self-taught person who enjoys solving problems, and I am the go-to person among 🤗friends and 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦family when they need help.
